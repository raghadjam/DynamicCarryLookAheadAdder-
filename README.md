# DynamicCarryLookAheadAdder-
This project presents a dynamic 1x1, 4x4, and 8x8 Carry Look Ahead Adder (CLA), implemented using dynamic XOR and  NAND gates. The 8x8 CLA is extended through modular  integration. The design leverages dynamic logic, utilizing pre charge and evaluation phases to achieve high speed while  maintaining scalability.
